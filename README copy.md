### 1. Design, Develop, and Implement

This project demonstrates a fully interactive front-end web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a weather API. It incorporates user-centric design principles, simple navigation, and responsive elements including alternative backgrounds for mobile devices and weather conditions.

- **Retro Weather** displays a background image that represents the current weather.
- **Retro Weather** is especially handy for those who travel and want to know the immediate weather at their destination.
- **Retro Weather** has been designed so users worldwide can view the weather where they are or in other countries.
- **Retro Weather** Shows the current time, date, and location for the area being searched.
- **Retro Weather** is a simple weather information page that uses the free tier of WeatherAPI.com.
- **Retro Weather** is a weather app accessible to everyone
